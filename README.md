This is a basic template for any React JS project which incorporates Bootstrap CSS.

No unnecessary modules have been installed. 

Bootstrap CSS has been included in the files using a CDN in the index.html. My experience with Bootstrap has lead to me using the CDN to initialize Bootstrap. Using npm command did not yield much results. 

React used is version 18.2.66


Steps to use: 


1. Open a new empty folder in VS Code. Copy the below code in the terminal 

        git clone https://github.com/nagaspammer1200/BasicReactStarter.git
        cd BasicReactStarter
        npm install 
        npm run dev

2. After the npm run dev, you should see instructions to load the basic structure locally

Happy Coding !!!
